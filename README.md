# Vehicle-Fine-Records-Management-System
Sharing the vehicle fine records poses some challenges regarding concealing the sensitive information as well as secured, transparent, and efficient distribution of the non-sensitive information. Thus, we propose a management system of vehicle fine records that implement a hybrid blockchain paired with security features that ensures decentralization, transparency, immutability, security, and improved performance.
